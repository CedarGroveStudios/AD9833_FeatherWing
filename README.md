The AD9833 Precision Waveform Generator FeatherWing is an Adafruit Feather-compatible module. The Waveform Generator produces an op-amp buffered sine, triangle, or square wave output with a practical frequency range of approximately 0 to 300KHz with 0.1Hz resolution. Frequency accuracy and stability is determined by the 25MHz clock source. Waveform Generator control is via the Feather SPI bus; chip select is provided by the Feather's D6 logic pin. Output signal peak-to-peak amplitude is adjustable with a maximum unipolar output of slightly less than 3.3 volts. The wing derives its power from the host Feather's 3.3V power.

The AD9833 Precision Waveform Generator FeatherWing was tested with a Feather M4 Express using CircuitPython version 4.1.0 rc-1. Example code is provided in the repository. Refer to the Analog Devices' AD9833 Waveform Generator data sheet for device control protocol details.
